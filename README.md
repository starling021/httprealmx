# httprealm
HTTP proxy for Realm of the Mad God written in Python 3.6

## Installation
Sadly no compiled binaries like .EXE are build yet ðŸ˜’

To build HTTPRealm from sources, simply use this commands:

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
git clone git://github.com/crinny/httprealm
cd httprealm
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

That's it!

## Documentation
Is going to be here later.
